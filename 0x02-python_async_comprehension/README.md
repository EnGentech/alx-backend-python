PEP 492 and PEP 525 introduce support for native coroutines and asynchronous generators using async / await syntax. This PEP proposes to add asynchronous versions of list, set, dict comprehensions and generator expressions.

Rationale and Goals
Python has extensive support for synchronous comprehensions, allowing to produce lists, dicts, and sets with a simple and concise syntax. We propose implementing similar syntactic constructions for the asynchronous code.

To illustrate the readability improvement, consider the following example:

result = []
async for i in aiter():
    if i % 2:
        result.append(i)
